# breeze.
an indev ubg project made in astro because:
1. i haven't used astro in so long and needed to exercise my skills
2. i needed a clean ubg site to use
3. i kinda wanted some movies on my school chromebook
4. i have nothing else to work on
5. i got mad at nautilusos because something wouldnt work, so what better to do than use typescript instead of js

## if you fork...
please star the project :P

also make sure you dont do the following:
- modify the agpl license
- claim this code as yours
- not give adequate credits
- use this in your website without credits
- detatch from fork network without giving credits
- do anything that violates the license
- literally just steal this and run away with it

but you can:
- deploy it without any changes made
- deploy it WITH changes (as long as credit is included and changes are included)
- some more other stuff that i cant remember

i recommend including this to stay safe:
